# OCR_EPITA
This is our OCR school project at EPITA

## Getting Started
After cloning you can launch the Makfile for the main.c code 
or use the Python scripts for the Neural Network

### Prerequisites
gcc (C99)
Python 3


## Running the tests
Python: 
	Xor: Use XOR script
	Grayscale: Use the Otsu: PaintGray function


C:
	Grayscale: There is a grayscale in C but it is the same in Python
	Segmentation: Only words are highlighted and detected 
	You can use `make && ./TIBO fichier1.png  fichier2.jpg` 

## File Architecture

## Project Avancement Recap
*how much have we done? what is left to be done?*

### What have we done 
	-Grayscale
	-Neural Network (Xor and a bit of images)
	-Segmentation
	-Image loading

### What we have to rework
	-Neural Network for Images
	-Segmentation (letters are not recognized)
	-Otsu
	-Better CLS

### What we have to do
	-Image Processing 
	-Interface
	-Neural Network
	-Full conversion in C
