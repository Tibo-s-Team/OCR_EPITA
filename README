# OCR_EPITA
This is our OCR school project at EPITA

## Getting Started
After cloning you can launch the Makfile for the main.c code 
or use the Python scripts for the Neural Network

### Prerequisites
- gcc (C99)
- Python 3

## File Architecture

```

        └── All the scripts used to run certain parts of the algorithm
```


## Project Avancement Recap

### What have we done 
- Image loading : Done
- Image preprocessing : Done
- Image filtering : Done

### What we have to rework
- Interface : Add filter selection and better previsualization
- Image segmentation : Better thresholding system 
	
### What we have to do
- Image rotation
